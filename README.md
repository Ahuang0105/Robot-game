# Robot game

This is actually an extra credit project for my Assembly Language course. This is the first time I ever use the MIPS to wrote a program. Overall this project got me an A for my Assembly Language course, and it's a fun experience. The "$" character is the enemy robot, and "X" represent the user. After each user movement the enemy robot will move 1 step toward the user. If robot catch user then user lose the game.  The only way to win the game is to let all enemy robot crash to wall.  The wall character is "#", and want robot crash into wall it will change to "@"
